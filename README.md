# Hi there! I'm Javier 👋🏻

Hello!

I'm a proud dad to a baby born in May this year, the husband of a Japanese wife, and currently living in Japan, where I work in international sales for a Japanese company.

As a 40-something Korean with a humanities background, programming was never on my radar. But one day, I became fascinated with smart farming and started a hobby project to build a plant cultivation environment using Arduino for my houseplants. That hobby opened the door to the world of programming, and I’ve been hooked ever since.

Even though I started learning later in life, I’ve been amazed at how much I enjoy it—time seems to fly when I’m coding! Now, I’m passionate about exploring new fields entirely unrelated to my current career, driven by a spark of enthusiasm I hadn’t expected.

This GitHub is where I document my journey of self-study and personal projects, including IoT, web server setups, web application deployments, and programming languages. My blog is also my learning space, guided by my one and only personal tutor—ChatGPT.

Let’s connect and learn together! 🚀
